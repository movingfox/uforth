# uForth has been superceded by ToolForth ([https://github.com/tcoram/toolboxforth])
uForth is a highly portable ANSI Forth-like language.
It can be easily ported to microcontrollers of all
sizes. No dynamic memory allocation required.

It implements a "switch" threaded Forth. Not 
super fast, but portable!
